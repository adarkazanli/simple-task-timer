        <h2>About Task Timer</h2>
        <p>
            Task Timer is an HTML5/JavaScript project I (Schuyler Cebulskie) created in order to fulfill my needs in keeping track of the time that I spent working for a company that I was an intern at. It has quickly become something with a wider range of uses, and has gained features very quickly in the past months. I began this project in August (or maybe September), and have continuously been working on it since. It started out as a boring old thing with absolutely no styles to it at all. I added styles a few days after the first release. After adding a link to make a suggestion for me, the most popular suggestion was to offer finer granularity in your goal time - it used to only be in hours. Since then, it's evolved into the version you're looking at.

            Task Timer is an open source project. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-task-timer/" target="_blank">Check it out on Google Code!</a>

        <h2 id="me">About me (Schuyler Cebulskie)</h2>
        <p>
            My usual alias is Gawdl3y. I'm a 12th grade student (senior!) in high school, and my favourite areas of study are the computer sciences. I've dumped a fair amount of time into many different coding languages, but I primarily work with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I finished a C++ class in school, I have done two years of Visual Basic 6.0, and am currently in a Java class. I enjoy working on projects such as these in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy playing computer and video games. I own a PS3, but it died. I plan on getting a new one very soon. You can add me to your friends list with the username SneakymodeEngage. I also enjoy playing games on the computer (modding!). You can add me on Steam via <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gawdl3y" target="_blank">my Steam profile</a>. I currently go back and forth between games, and I don't play a certain one the most, really. I built my own computer, and I finally put a <a href="http://msi.com/product/vga/N670-PE-2GD5-OC.html">GTX 670</a> in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a website! <a href="http://gawdl3y.com/" target="_blank">Gawdl3y.com</a> It's actually down for now, but it'll be back at some point in the future.
